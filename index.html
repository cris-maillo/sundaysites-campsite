          My primary school organized a one-off camping stay at the school football 
          fields for the eldest year group. It finally became our turn, and looking 
          back, I remember staying in my best friend's massive camel-coloured camping 
          tent and having mini variety pack cereal boxes for breakfast.

          Two of my close school friends use to celebrate their birthday at their dad's house. 
          He also had a basketball arcade machine. One year, we camped in their lawn. 
          I remember the group of boys splitting a single can of beer around and being extremely angry
          at them for not letting me sleep.

          My dad organized this hike up Peña Ubiña. Him, my brother, and I were joined by a few other family friends. I remember seeing a Moka pot for the first time there, not much else.
          Looking back, as I do quite often, I wish I had been more open to camping and going on hikes with him.

          My brother and I stayed here for a week when I was 15 or 16 with my grandad. 
          I don't really remember being remotely close to a beach. We stayed in his camping trailer that 
          used to be stored in our garage.
          I remember the camping shop and having to paint the toenails of his now ex-wife.
